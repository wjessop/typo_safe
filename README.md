# TypoSafe

Protect your Ruby code from typos! You've heard of Type Safe languages, well now Ruby can be Typo Safe! Typo Safe code will revolutionise programming.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'typo_safe'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install typo_safe

## Usage

I'm pretty sure you don't ever want to use this gem, not even in development. That said, should you decide that this code is for you you can use it as follows:

### Typo Safe a single class written by a fat-fingered developer:

```ruby
require 'typo_safe'

class SomeClass
	include TypoSafe

	def print_hell0
		puts "hello from the print_hello method!"
	end

	def print_goodbye
		puts "goodbye from the print_goodbye method!"
	end
end

SomeClass.new.print_hello
SomeClass.new.pring_goodbye
```

## TODO

* Make the gem respect public/private methods (at the moment you can call a private method by using a typo)
* Benchmark Levenshtein calculations and possibly cache
* At the moment when there is a conflict (two methods have the same Levenshtein distance) the first is picked, maybe favour locally defined methods over inherited methods
* Make including TypoSafe on Object work (for global protection!)
